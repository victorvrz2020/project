# Assignment-6 Project

The three main goals of this repository were 
1. To practice how the proper naming of files.
2. How to organize them into a project.
3. How to set up virtual environments.

To fulfill the first two goals, we worked on a forked copy from the data set of the remote repository 'https://github.com/yuliaUU/files_to_copy'. 
These files of this copy were renamed by taking into account the three principles for effective file names:
- Machine-readable files.
- Easy to explore for a human.
- Play well with default ordering.

They were also organized in a coherent structure such that information can be easily extracted from here.

To fulfill the third goal, a new environmet was created such that the **Report.ipynb** file in the **'repots'** folder can be run on Jupyter Lab.
